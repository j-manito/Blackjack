# Blackjack
By Juan Guzman

I made this simple project to create a casino-styled blackjack game between the dealer and the player. The goal is to have the player feel immersed in the program by having a hit/stand mechanic with win rate percentages fluctuating in between hits.

I approached this project much more simply by having the barebone game rather incorporating prominent features such as betting and splitting. I used random algorithms, probability calculations to calculate the win percentage for the player after each card hit, and player input when executing this program.

To run this program, copy and paste the code in your selected IDE for C++ and execute the source code. To proceed forward, you will be asked a Y/N question whether you'd like a card hit or stand. The dealer will then draw and whether either player or dealer busts or has the closest card value to 21 will determine the outcome alongside your probability of winning with each hit. Just like good ol' blackjack. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my little program.
